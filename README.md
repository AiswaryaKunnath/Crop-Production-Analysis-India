## Problem Statement

Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, providing employment to millions of people and contributing significantly to the country's GDP. However, the sector is faced with several challenges, including climate change, low productivity, and food security issues. The objectives of this project is to provide valuable insights into crop yields, area under cultivation, Temperature and other metrics that can inform agricultural policies , identify trends and patterns in agricultural production, helping farmers and policymakers make informed decisions about crop selection, irrigation, and other important factors that affect agricultural productivity.The dataset which I collected from Kaggle, contains comprehensive data on crop production statistics for India, categorized by state and district. The dataset covers four major crop seasons, namely kharif, rabbi, summer, and autumn, from the year 1997 to 2020. The data provides information on the annual production and yield of crops grown in different parts of the country.
